# GifTastic

* This application communicates with the API Giphy. 
* This application uses Javascript, JQuery and AJAX.

The applicateion is pre-loaded with few default topics. 
It also comes with an option to serach for new topics per user's desire. Once the new topic is typed in the tab and submitted, a corresponding button is generated for it.

Upon clicking any of these topic buttons, The application promptly searches the Giphy API for ten GIFs related to that title and displays it on the page. 
The corresponding rating and tile metadata is also listed with the GIFs.

This search process is optimized:
- to return image results as soon as one of the default buttons are clicked on.
- return error message if the input value is blank in new GIF serach form.
